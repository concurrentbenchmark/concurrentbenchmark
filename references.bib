abstract = {From the Publisher:Mobile systems, whose components communicate and change their structure, now pervade the informational world and the wider world of which it is a part. The science of mobile systems is as yet immature, however. This book presents the pi-calculus, a theory of mobile systems. The pi-calculus provides a conceptual framework for understanding mobility, and mathematical tools for expressing systems and reasoning about their behaviors. The book serves both as a reference for the theory and as an extended demonstration of how to use pi-calculus to describe systems and analyze their properties. It covers the basic theory of pi-calculus, typed pi-calculi, higher-order processes, the relationship between pi-calculus and lambda-calculus, and applications of pi-calculus to object-oriented design and programming. The book is written at the graduate level, assuming no prior acquaintance with the subject, and is intended for computer scientists interested in mobile systems.}

abstract = {Communication is a central elements in software development. As a potential typed foundation for structured communication-centered programming, session types have been studied over the past decade for a wide range of process calculi and programming languages, focusing on binary (two-party) sessions. This work extends the foregoing theories of binary session types to multiparty, asynchronous sessions, which often arise in practical communication-centered applications. Presented as a typed calculus for mobile processes, the theory introduces a new notion of types in which interactions involving multiple peers are directly abstracted as a global scenario. Global types retain the friendly type syntax of binary session types while specifying dependencies and capturing complex causal chains of multiparty asynchronous interactions. A global type plays the role of a shared agreement among communication peers and is used as a basis of efficient type-checking through its projection onto individual peers. The fundamental properties of the session type discipline, such as communication safety, progress, and session fidelity, are established for general n-party asynchronous interactions.},

abstract = {Multiparty Session Types (MPST) are a typing discipline ensuring that a message-passing process implements a multiparty session protocol, without errors. In this paper, we propose a new, generalised MPST theory. Our contribution is fourfold. (1) We demonstrate that a revision of the theoretical foundations of MPST is necessary: classic MPST have a limited subject reduction property, with inherent restrictions that are easily overlooked, and in previous work have led to flawed type safety proofs; our new theory removes such restrictions and fixes such flaws. (2) We contribute a new MPST theory that is less complicated, and yet more general, than the classic one: it does not require global multiparty session types nor binary session type duality — instead, it is grounded on general behavioural type-level properties, and proves type safety of many more protocols and processes. (3) We produce a detailed analysis of type-level properties, showing how, in our new theory, they allow to ensure decidability of type checking, and statically guarantee that processes enjoy, , deadlock-freedom and liveness at run-time. (4) We show how our new theory can integrate type and model checking: type-level properties can be expressed in modal µ-calculus, and verified with well-established tools.},
