abstract = {From the Publisher:Mobile systems, whose components communicate and change their structure, now pervade the informational world and the wider world of which it is a part. The science of mobile systems is as yet immature, however. This book presents the pi-calculus, a theory of mobile systems. The pi-calculus provides a conceptual framework for understanding mobility, and mathematical tools for expressing systems and reasoning about their behaviors. The book serves both as a reference for the theory and as an extended demonstration of how to use pi-calculus to describe systems and analyze their properties. It covers the basic theory of pi-calculus, typed pi-calculi, higher-order processes, the relationship between pi-calculus and lambda-calculus, and applications of pi-calculus to object-oriented design and programming. The book is written at the graduate level, assuming no prior acquaintance with the subject, and is intended for computer scientists interested in mobile systems.}

abstract = {Communication is a central elements in software development. As a potential typed foundation for structured communication-centered programming, session types have been studied over the past decade for a wide range of process calculi and programming languages, focusing on binary (two-party) sessions. This work extends the foregoing theories of binary session types to multiparty, asynchronous sessions, which often arise in practical communication-centered applications. Presented as a typed calculus for mobile processes, the theory introduces a new notion of types in which interactions involving multiple peers are directly abstracted as a global scenario. Global types retain the friendly type syntax of binary session types while specifying dependencies and capturing complex causal chains of multiparty asynchronous interactions. A global type plays the role of a shared agreement among communication peers and is used as a basis of efficient type-checking through its projection onto individual peers. The fundamental properties of the session type discipline, such as communication safety, progress, and session fidelity, are established for general n-party asynchronous interactions.},

abstract = {Multiparty Session Types (MPST) are a typing discipline ensuring that a message-passing process implements a multiparty session protocol, without errors. In this paper, we propose a new, generalised MPST theory. Our contribution is fourfold. (1) We demonstrate that a revision of the theoretical foundations of MPST is necessary: classic MPST have a limited subject reduction property, with inherent restrictions that are easily overlooked, and in previous work have led to flawed type safety proofs; our new theory removes such restrictions and fixes such flaws. (2) We contribute a new MPST theory that is less complicated, and yet more general, than the classic one: it does not require global multiparty session types nor binary session type duality — instead, it is grounded on general behavioural type-level properties, and proves type safety of many more protocols and processes. (3) We produce a detailed analysis of type-level properties, showing how, in our new theory, they allow to ensure decidability of type checking, and statically guarantee that processes enjoy, , deadlock-freedom and liveness at run-time. (4) We show how our new theory can integrate type and model checking: type-level properties can be expressed in modal µ-calculus, and verified with well-established tools.},

abstract="Compiler correctness proofs for higher-order concurrent languages are difficult: they involve establishing a termination-preserving refinement between a concurrent high-level source language and an implementation that uses low-level shared memory primitives. However, existing logics for proving concurrent refinement either neglect properties such as termination, or only handle first-order state. In this paper, we address these limitations by extending Iris, a recent higher-order concurrent separation logic, with support for reasoning about termination-preserving refinements. To demonstrate the power of these extensions, we prove the correctness of an efficient implementation of a higher-order, session-typed language. To our knowledge, this is the first program logic capable of giving a compiler correctness proof for such a language. The soundness of our extensions and our compiler correctness proof have been mechanized in Coq.",

They guarantee type soundness and session fidelity for concurrent programs with sophisticated communication protocols. As type soundness proofs for languages with session types are tedious and technically involved, it is rare to see mechanized soundness proofs for these systems.We present an executable intrinsically typed small-step semantics for a realistic functional session type calculus. The calculus includes linearity, recursion, and recursive sessions with subtyping. Asynchronous communication is modeled with an encoding.The semantics is implemented in Agda as an intrinsically typed, interruptible CEK machine. This implementation proves type preservation and a particular notion of progress by construction.},

However, regarding the concurrency paradigm, previous work essentially focused on formalization of abstract systems, such as pure concurrent calculi, which are too minimal to be realistic. In this paper, we propose a library that enables verification of realistic concurrent programs in the Coq proof assistant. Our approach is based on an extension of the π-calculus whose encoding enables such programs to be modeled conveniently. This encoding is coupled with a specification language akin to spatial logics, including in particular a notion of fairness, which is important to write satisfactory specifications for realistic concurrent programs. In order to facilitate formal proof, we propose a collection of lemmas that can be reused in the context of different verifications. Among these lemmas, the most effective for simplifying the proof task take advantage of confluence properties. In order to evaluate feasibility of verification of concurrent programs using this library, we perform verification for a non-trivial application.}

We assume constructors for constants, variables, application and lambda-abstraction. Other constants represent a function Fv that returns the set of free variables in a term and a function that substitutes a term for a variable free in another term. Our axioms are (1) equations relating Fv and each constructor, (2) equations relating substitution and each constructor, (3) alpha-conversion itself, (4) unique existence of functions on lambda-terms defined by structural iteration, and (5) construction of lambda-abstractions given certain functions from variables to terms. By building a model from de Bruijn's nameless lambda-terms, we show that our five axioms are a conservative extension of HOL. Theorems provable from the axioms include distinctness, injectivity and an exhaustion principle for the constructors, principles of structural induction and primitive recursion on lambda-terms, Hindley and Seldin's substitution lemmas and the existence of their length function. These theorems and the model have been mechanically checked in the Cambridge HOL system.",

We prove induction schemes for both the terms and some properties of the calculus which internalize the re-naming of bound variables. We show that despite the fact the terms which formalize the calculus are not generated by a last fixed point relation, we can prove the desired inversion lemmas.

abstract = {We present a large and we think also significant case study in computer assisted formal reasoning. We start by giving a higher-order abstract syntax encoding of π-calculus in the higher-order inductive/coinductive-type theories CIC and CC(Co)Ind. This encoding gives rise to a full-fledged proof editor/proof assistant for the π-calculus, once we embed it in Coq, an interactive proof-development environment for CC(Co)Ind. Using this computerized assistant we prove formally a substantial chapter of the theory of strong late bisimilarity, which amounts essentially to Section 2 of A calculus of mobile processes by Milner, Parrow, and Walker. This task is greatly simplified by the use of higher-order syntax. In fact, not only we can delegate conveniently to the metalanguage α-conversion and substitution, but, introducing a suitable axiomatization of the theory of contexts, we can accommodate also the machinery for generating new names. The axiomatization we introduce is quite general and should be easily portable to other formalizations based on higher-order syntax. The use of coinductive types and corresponding tactics allows to give alternative, and possibly more natural, proofs of many properties of strong late bisimilarity, w.r.t. those originally given by Milner, Parrow, and Walker.}

The ∇ quantifier helps with the delicate issues surrounding the scope of variables within φ-calculus expressions and their executions (proofs). We illustrate several merits of the logical specifications permitted by this logic: they are natural and declarative; they contain no side-conditions concerning names of variables while maintaining a completely formal treatment of such variables; differences between late and open bisimulation relations arise from familar logic distinctions; the interplay between the three quantifiers (∀, ∃, and ∇) and their scopes can explain the differences between early and late bisimulation and between various modal operators based on bound input and output actions; and proof search involving the application of inference rules, unification, and backtracking can provide complete proof systems for one-step transitions, bisimulation, and satisfaction in modal logic. We also illustrate how one can encode the φ-calculus with replications, in an extended logic with induction and co-induction.},

As such, it is a suitable vehicle for formalizing the meta-theory of formal systems such as logics and programming languages. This tutorial exposes Abella incrementally, starting with its capabilities at a first-order logic level and gradually presenting more sophisticated features, ending with the support it offers to the two-level logic approach to meta-theoretic reasoning.

Their type safety is thus extremely important. EMTST is a tool to aid in representing and validating theorems about session types in the Coq proof assistant. On paper, these proofs are often tricky, and error prone. In proof assistants, they are typically long and difficult to prove. In this work, we propose a library that helps validate the theory of session types calculi in proof assistants. As a case study, we study two of the most used binary session types systems: we show the impossibility of representing the first system in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha {\$}{\$}-equivalent representations, and we prove type preservation for the revisited system. We develop our tool in the Coq proof assistant, using locally nameless for binders and small scale reflection to simplify the handling of linear typing environments.",

abstract = {We present Pirouette, a language for typed higher-order functional choreographic programming. Pirouette offers programmers the ability to write a centralized functional program and compile it via endpoint projection into programs for each node in a distributed system. Moreover, Pirouette is defined generically over a (local) language of messages, and lifts guarantees about the message type system to its own. Message type soundness also guarantees deadlock freedom. All of our results are verified in Coq.},

abstract="The aim of this work is to obtain an interactive proof environment based on Isabelle/HOL for reasoning formally about cryptographic protocols, expressed as processes of the spi calculus (a $\pi$-calculus with cryptographic primitives). To this end, we formalise syntax, semantics, and hedged bisimulation, an environment-sensitive bisimulation which can be used for proving security properties of protocols. In order to deal smoothly with binding operators and reason up-to $\alpha$-equivalence of bound names, we adopt the new Nominal datatype package. This simplifies both the encoding, and the formal proofs, which turn out to correspond closely to ``manual proofs''.",

abstract = {We use the interactive theorem prover Isabelle to prove that the algebraic axiomatization of bisimulation equivalence in the pi-calculus is sound and complete. This is the first proof of its kind to be wholly machine checked. Although the result has been known for some time the proof had parts which needed careful attention to detail to become completely formal. It is not that the result was ever in doubt; rather, our contribution lies in the methodology to prove completeness and get absolute certainty that the proof is correct, while at the same time following the intuitive lines of reasoning of the original proof. Completeness of axiomatizations is relevant for many variants of the calculus, so our method has applications beyond this single result. We build on our previous effort of implementing a framework for the pi-calculus in Isabelle using the nominal data type package, and strengthen our claim that this framework is well suited to represent the theory of the pi-calculus, especially in the smooth treatment of bound names.}

url={https://journals.agh.edu.pl/csci/article/view/1413},
DOI={10.7494/csci.2017.18.3.1413},
abstractNote={Modern software systems rely on communication, for example mobile applcations communicating with a central server, distributed systems coordinaing a telecommunications network, or concurrent systems handling events and processes in a desktop application. However, reasoning about concurrent prgrams is hard, since we must reason about each process and the order in which communication might happen between processes. In this paper, I describe a type-driven approach to implementing communicating concurrent programs, using the dependently typed programming language Idris. I show how the type system can be used to describe resource access protocols (such as controlling access to a file handle) and verify that programs correctly follow those prtools. Finally, I show how to use the type system to reason about the order of communication between concurrent processes, ensuring that each end of a communication channel follows a defined protocol.},
