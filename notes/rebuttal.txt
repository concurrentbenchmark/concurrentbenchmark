One weakness is that the paper doesn't describe any existing fulfilments of the challenges,

==> yes, but that was exactly the content of first POPLMark: just the selection of a benchmark, a well-known one and no solutions

Another weakness is that the paper does not justify why it's worthwhile to boost research on mechanizing proofs about process calculi as opposed to some other metatheory. POPLmark itself looked at type systems; there must be dozens of new type systems with theorems and proofs published each year, so there was some motivation for mechanised support. In the case, of process calculi there are far fewer new systems each year. Why should an expert on mechanized proof devote their attention to process calculi as opposed to other forms of PL metatheory?

==>  exactly because there is little effort. Vasco's proofs are a disaster, the one in Sangiorgi just sketches
