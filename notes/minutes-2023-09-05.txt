#+title: Minutes: Meeting about Formalization Efforts
#+date: 2023-09-05

* Participants
- Frederik Krogsdal Jacobsen, DTU, Every challenge in Isabelle using locally nameless and sets
- Alberto Momigliano and Andrea Tirelli, Milano, Linearity in Abella and in Twelf
- Daniel Zackon, McGill, Linearity in Beluga using explicit context manipulation
- Dawit Tirore, ITU, Linearity in Coq using pure de Bruijn indices and list positions
- Kaustuv Chaudhuri, INRIA, Working on Abella
- Lorenzo Gheri, Oxford, working in Coq or Isabelle/Nominal
- Francisco Ferreira, Royal Holloway, maybe working in Agda

** Cancellations
- Marco Carbone, ITU
- Dale Miller, INRIA

** Coinduction
- Frederik has formalized half of it
- Main issue: does the challenge actually need "interesting" coinductive techniques?
  - In particular, is the behaviour too simple to actually need coinduction?
    - Probably not: it seems like (simple) up-to techniques are needed for this kind of problem
- Operational semantics in the coinduction challenge
  - Inductive semantics + congruence
  - We have again a context, and we could also present it without one
  - We could instead use a compatibility relation
  - Conclusion: Alberto will try to write a presentation using a compatibility layer and we can compare

** Linearity
- Alberto has pushed a number of improvements
- Alberto has some ideas for simplifying the challenge
- We don't need qualifiers in our simple case
- We might not need context splits in the paper case
- We should change to Alberto's presentation, which is simpler and probably more correct

** Scope Extrusion
- Unclear whether there are any issues with this except for certain proof assistants in the LF tradition (by design)
- It has already been done in Abella, so it should be possible in Beluga

** Can we have a general base language?
- Can we have sums in the coinduction challenge?
  - Yes, but they don't "do" anything
