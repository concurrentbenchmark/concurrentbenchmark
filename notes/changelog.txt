# 12/07/2023 - ST30 Talk Proposal

Changes:
- Clarify that "the previous benchmarks" in the first paragraph refer to POPLMark and POPLMark Reloaded.
- Removed the first sentence of section 2, which was redundant.
- Add type theory as a subject from which knowledge is required to understand the challenges.
- Clarify that an inductive (or coinductive) proof principle is needed in the definition of strong barbed bisimilarity in the scope extrusion challenge.
- Fix a typo: caluclus -> calculus.

Responses to comments:
- I agree that it is a stretch to say that linearity only requires basic knowledge of type theory, but I cannot think of a good way to introduce this caveat. If anyone has a good idea, please let me know :-)
- In the scope extrusion challenge I don't see any reason to introduce congruence, since we don't care about up-to techniques in this part of the challenge.
- There is a lot of repetition wrt. notation and conventions in the challenge problems. For now this is intentional to make sure we don't forget anything while the challenges are still subject to change, but in the final challenge description we should consolidate this into a "common core" for the problems.

Changes:
- Remove white space and some redundant words/sentences to bring the main part of the paper under 2 pages.
- Fix overfull hbox caused by a long process description.
- Clarify that linearity is also necessary for other things than just session types.
- Add some motivation for explicitly reasoning about scope extrusion to the challenge description in the appendix.

Responses to comments:
- I think that there may well be a better challenge than congruence for the coinduction challenge, but I can't think of any that does not require a lot of specialised definitions. The idea of using congruence is to allow using up-to techniques for the proof. Please feel free to suggest ideas!
- I agree that the paper is quite long including the appendices, but I think it is good to have the challenges directly available for the reviewers in the paper.
