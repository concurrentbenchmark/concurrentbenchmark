Notes to abstract:

A.1.3 in finite case, sb-bisim still needs to be defined so as to have
some (co)inductive principle to use in the proof. Just make clear that
it is not simply a fixed point (case analysis)

Thm 1. Would it make any difference (i.e. more interesting) to prove conguence here?

A.2.1 there is a lot of repetitions here wrt A.1.1 and A.3.1
explaining the notation for processes, convention for names etc. If
this is intentional, I find it a bit distracting.
