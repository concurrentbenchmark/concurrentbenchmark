Current plan

-> more detailed description of the challenges (TBD the level of
  details in proofs)

-> solutions to the linear one.

-- Emphasis on techniques (tags, splitting, etc. rather than actual
   implementations in each system). Give a mathematical description not code (when possible)

-- Downplay the binder issue, unless it significantly interacts with linearity

----------------------
Solutions

1. Tagged lists (Daniel/Alberto)

2. Linear predicate DB (Marco). Mention Linear predicate HOAS

3. Intrinsic ? (Luca?)

4. Dictionaries (Francisco?)
