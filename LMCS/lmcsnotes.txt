Current plan(s)

1.  more detailed description of ALL the challenges (TBD the level of
  details in proofs)

-> solutions to the linear one.

2. Just exposition of the first challenge and then the 4 (?)
solutions. Reverse engeener the level of details of the expository part from the solutions.

  NOTE: if we do 2., we could generalize the challenge to include delegation, which (by using the reduxtion semantics) is easier

In any case:

-- Emphasis on techniques (tags, splitting, etc. rather than actual
   implementations in each system). Give a mathematical description not code (when possible)

-- Downplay the binder issue, unless it significantly interacts with linearity

----------------------
Solutions to subject reduction

1. Tagged lists (Daniel/Alberto)

2. Linear predicate DB (Marco). Mention Linear predicate HOAS

3. Intrinsic typing in Agda (Luca)

4. Dictionaries (Francisco?)

-----------------

Solution to safety ???
