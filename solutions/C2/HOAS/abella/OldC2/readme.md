This is a ripoff (with minor adaptations by AM) from the Abella library as
originally authored by Miller & Tiu

 Proof Search Specifications of Bisimulation and Modal Logics for the Ï€-calculus, by Alwen Tiu and Dale Miller. ACM Transactions on Computational Logic. 

To quote
%% A specification of the late transition system for the finite pi calculus.
%% Given that the meta-logic of Abella is intuitionistic, the
%% specification of bisimulation here corresponds to open bisimulation.

==> so, needs to be ported to strong barbed, see barbed.thm


Notes on the challenge (wrt open bisimulation)

reflexivity: much simpler to prove coinductively (3
cases). Inductively, I cannot

transitivity literally same proof (ind vs coind)

symmetry comes from mere case analysis

what is scary is: the coinductive equivalence relation proof does not use anything
of the LTS: it may as well be abstract!

--- minor stuff

taup could be dropped
